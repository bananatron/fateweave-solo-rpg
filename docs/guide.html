<h1>Fateweaver’s Quest</h1>
<h2>Solo Adventure Rules Companion</h2>

<h3>What is this page?</h3>
<p>
  This document tells you <strong>how to use the helper app</strong> and the
  <strong>core story‑telling loop</strong> of Fateweaver’s Quest.  
  Keep it open beside the web app as a quick reference.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the helper app and click “<em>Begin Adventure</em>”.</li>
  <li>Name your hero (or hit “Random Name”).</li>
  <li>Pick an <strong>Archetype</strong> (or create one), a
      <strong>Talent</strong>, then press “<em>Begin Adventure</em>”.</li>
  <li>Read the first Story Log entry—it is your opening scene.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Understanding the Screen</h2>

<h3>Left panel</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Character sheet</strong> – live stats &amp; scars.</li>
  <li><strong>Story Clock</strong> – 6 segments; fill one when the story
      escalates (see §4).</li>
  <li><strong>Story Log</strong> – your running narrative.  
      Use “Undo” to erase the last line or “Clear” to wipe everything.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Center panel (tabs)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Map</strong> – drop or explore rooms; the latest room is blue.</li>
  <li><strong>Actions</strong> – roll Fate Dice (2d6) or resolve combat.</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle</strong> – ask Yes/No questions for guidance.</li>
  <li><strong>Details</strong> – get quick sensory prompts for descriptions.</li>
  <li><strong>NPC / Monsters / Factions / Quests</strong> – instant generators.</li>
  <li><strong>Journal</strong> – free‑text notes that also copy to the Story Log.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3. Core Mechanics</h2>

<h3>Fate Dice</h3>
<p>
  Roll 2d6 and read the table in the Actions tab:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any 6 = <strong>Great Success</strong></li>
  <li>Total 8‑11 = <strong>Success&nbsp;with&nbsp;complication</strong></li>
  <li>Total 4‑7 = <strong>Failure&nbsp;with&nbsp;opportunity</strong></li>
  <li>Total &lt;4 = <strong>Disaster</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Combat Roll</h3>
<p>
  Click “Combat Roll”.  
  The text explains the cost in Scars and enemy outcome.
</p>

<h3>Scars</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Three filled circles = you fall and the adventure ends.</li>
  <li>Use “+ / –” to add or heal Scars when fictionally justified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Story Clock</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add one segment when you suffer a <em>Failure</em> or <em>Disaster</em>,
      when time clearly passes, or whenever the fiction escalates.</li>
  <li>At 6 segments a <strong>Major Event</strong> fires automatically, then
      the clock resets.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. The Scene Loop</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Frame the scene</strong>  
      – Where are you? What is the immediate goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Act</strong>  
      – Move on the map, ask the Oracle, fight, talk, or use a generator.</li>
  <li><strong>Roll</strong>  
      – When an outcome is uncertain, roll Fate Dice or Combat Roll.</li>
  <li><strong>Update the fiction</strong>  
      – Type a short sentence in the Story Log (or let buttons add it).</li>
  <li><strong>Check clocks &amp; scars</strong>  
      – Apply consequences, talents, or Scars.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance the scene when</strong> any of these are true:
    <ul>
      <li>The current question is answered.</li>
      <li>A clear success/failure moves the story forward.</li>
      <li>You change location (new room or travel montage).</li>
      <li>Real‑world time passes and the situation cools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
